<h1>Lorand's top 3 movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1.Interstellar</h3>
<p>
    I abslolutly love the way the science and some quantum phisics are protraited in this movie.
</p>
<h4>Here you can find a short description of the movie.</h4>
<p>
    Earth's future has been riddled by disasters, famines, and droughts. 
    There is only one way to ensure mankind's survival: Interstellar travel. 
    A newly discovered wormhole in the far reaches of our solar system allows a 
    team of astronauts to go where no man has gone before, a planet that 
    may have the right environment to sustain human life.

<h3>2.Prometheus</h3>
<p>
    Given the above movie, Interstellar, Prometheus aims to answer one question 
    that intrigues me: Who created humans, and why?
</p>
<h4>Here you can find a short description of the movie.</h4>
<p>
    Following a faint trail of clues, the accomplished archaeologist, Doctor 
    Elizabeth Shaw, and her partner, Charlie Holloway, along with a seventeen-man
     crew, embark on an ambitious, deep-space scientific expedition. Aboard the 
     revolutionary space-exploration starship, USCSS Prometheus, the team sets 
     foot on the rocky terrain of the desolate exomoon, LV-223, in 2093, to 
     investigate the existence of the superior extraterrestrial species known 
     as the "Engineers". But, there, inside a mysterious, complex structure of 
     cavernous dark chambers and an intricate underground system of tunnels, 
     more enigmas await. Now, a terrifying discovery threatens not only the 
     outcome of the bold outer-space mission but also the very future of 
     humankind. Is the world prepared for the answers to the fundamental 
     questions of human existence?
</p>

<h3>3.Alien: Covenant</h3>
<p>
    The sequel to Prometheus, I find it amazing how to story unfolds to show 
    that the ones who created humans are not that allpowerfull as we tough
</p>
<h4>Here you can find a short description of the movie.</h4>
<p>
    In 2104, almost eleven years after the disastrous expedition to the distant 
    moon, LV-223, in Prometheus (2012), the deep-space colonisation vessel, 
    USCSS Covenant, is on course for the remote planet, Origae-6, with more 
    than 2,000 colonists in cryogenic hibernation to build a new world. Instead,
     a rogue transmission entices the crew to a nearby habitable planet which 
     resembles Earth. As a result, the unsuspecting crewmembers of the Covenant 
     will have to cope with biological foes beyond human comprehension. Now, 
     what started as a peaceful exploratory mission, will soon turn into a 
     desperate rescue operation in uncharted space. Is there an escape from the 
     treacherous, mysterious planet? â€”Nick Riganas
